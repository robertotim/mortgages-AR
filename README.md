AR property listings/mortgages app to enhance the customer experience. #SIXHackathon

This application pulls property listings using the Zoopla api allowing users to search for homes they may want to buy.

Primarily targeted at first-time buyers, the app allows users to view property listings in 3D, being able to manipulate the model will provide users with a better experience in terms of visualising their future investments and securing their future.

For home-buyers this is a better user experience. 

For banks the benefit is having users that want to take out a mortgage with them as they already have financial data on their users. The other benefit is this is not limited to first-time buyers, it is also a method of increasing customer retention for people who want to remortgage or plan on renovating their home.
